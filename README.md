ðŸ“˜ NumPy Practice:
This notebook is a basic practice file for learning NumPy, a powerful Python library used for numerical operations. It includes:

Importing NumPy â€“ Using import numpy as np.

Creating Lists and Arrays â€“ Shows the difference between Python lists and NumPy arrays.

Array Properties â€“ Uses .shape, .dtype, .ndim to explore array structure.

Indexing & Slicing â€“ Demonstrates accessing elements and sub-arrays.

Mathematical Operations â€“ Performs addition, multiplication, min, max, mean, etc.

Reshaping Arrays â€“ Changes array shapes using .reshape().

Random Numbers â€“ Generates random arrays using np.random.
